"use strict";

//Introduction to variables

//variables can store some information
//we can use that information later
//we can change that information later

//declare a variable

var firstName = "Shubham";

//use a variable
console.log(firstName);

//change value
firstName = "Bruce";

//var firstname = "Barry";  without "use strict", it is allowed. Also we can declare variables without using var keyword also. lastName = "Allen"
